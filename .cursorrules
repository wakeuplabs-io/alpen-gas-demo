# Cursor Rules for BTC-Gas EVM Counter Demo

This project follows specific architecture patterns and conventions. Please read the following documentation files before making changes:

## Documentation Files

1. **docs/HANDOVER.md** - Complete project overview, requirements, and implementation guide
2. **docs/ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md** - Detailed architecture patterns, coding standards, and examples

## Key Principles

- Follow the architecture rules defined in `ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md`
- Backend: Route Handlers → Services → External APIs
- Frontend: Components → Hooks → API Client → Backend
- Keep code simple and self-readable
- Use JSDoc for backend methods only when it adds value beyond the method name

## Project Structure

- `packages/ui/` - Frontend React application
- `packages/api/` - Backend Hono API
- All documentation in `docs/`: `docs/HANDOVER.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md`

## When Making Changes

1. Check `docs/ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md` for patterns and examples
2. Follow the separation of concerns (handlers → services, components → hooks)
3. Maintain type safety with TypeScript interfaces
4. Keep error handling consistent with documented patterns
